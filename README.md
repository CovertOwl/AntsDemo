# AntsDemo
A 3-5 day rapid-prototyping challenge to create a simulation of simple ant behaviour in a procedurally generated world.  

## Feaure Summary
* Simple procedurally generated world
* A* pathfinding through fixed grid nodes
  
# Quick How-To's
## How to Play
You control the camera, by default press WSAD to move and use the mouse wheel to zoom. When you are finished, press escape to exit.

## How to Test Pathfinding
While in editor mode:  
1. Ensure at least one GameObject in the scene has a PathingTestController attached.  
2. Run the simulation.  
3. Left click to select passable nodes, storing them as origin points for paths.  
4. When ready to start the path, right click on a passable node.  
NOTE: Paths are generated over time, and may not instantly appear.  
  
## How to change world generation.
While in editor mode:  
1. Open the Main scene (Scenes/Main)  
2. In the scene heirachy, highlight the "Terrain Actor" node (Root/Terrain Actor)  
3. In the inspector, change the values for the "Simple Terrain Actor" script.  
	*Terrain Data/Seed - Seed value for world  
	*Terrain Data/Generation Data/Amplitude Persistence - Noise generation variable  
	*Terrain Data/Generation Data/Frequency Persistence - Noise generation variable  
	*Terrain Data/Generation Data/Frequency - Noise generation variable  
	*Terrain Data/Generation Data/Amplitude - Noise generation variable  
	*Terrain Data/Generation Data/Octaves - Noise generation variable  
	*Terrain Data/Generation Data/Dim X - Size of the terrain along the X axis, in Unity units  
	*Terrain Data/Generation Data/Dim Y - Size of the terrain along the Y axis, in Unity units  
	*Terrain Data/Generation Data/Tile Dim - Dimensions of terrain tiles, in Unity units  
	*Terrain Data/Tile Init Data - Array of tiles which are used ase on the noise function  
	*Terrain Data/Tile Init Data/X/Tile/Name - Name of the tile, must be unique  
	*Terrain Data/Tile Init Data/X/Tile/Passable - Can the tile be passed through?  
	*Terrain Data/Tile Init Data/X/Tile/Height Value Minimum - If the noise height value at a position in the terrain is greater than or equal to this value and less than Height Value Maximum, then this tile is spawned.  
	*Terrain Data/Tile Init Data/X/Tile/Height Value Maximum - If the noise height value at a position in the terrain is greater than or equal to the Height Value Minimum and less than this value, then this tile is spawned.  
	*Terrain Data/Tile Init Data/X/Terrain Prefab - The prefab spawned to represent the tile.  
NOTE: Currently, the world is generated each time a value is changed.  
  
##How to view the test world generation
While in editor mode:  
1. Open the Main scene (Scenes/Main)  
2. In the scene heirachy, highlight the "Root" node  
3. In the inspector, change the terrain type value for the "World Actor" script to "Test".  
NOTE: Switching back to the "Simple" terrain type will not restore the world as the settings will no longer be populated. Simply re-load Main scene to restore the world.
